//! Libp2p-rs is a peer-to-peer framework.
//!
//! ## Summary
//!
//! The crate is aimed at implementing a framework that light weight, simple, reliable, high performance, and friendly to users.
//!
//! ### Concept
//!
//! #### Multiaddr
//!
//! [Multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) aims to make network addresses future-proof, composable, and efficient.
//!
//! It can express almost all network protocols, such as:
//! - TCP/IP: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/1337`
//! - DNS/IP: `/dns4/localhost/tcp/1337`
//! - UDP: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/1234`
//!
