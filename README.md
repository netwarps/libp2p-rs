[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/netwarps/libp2p-rs.svg?token=tEt4wqXiQg5sktaf43jn&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/netwarps/libp2p-rs)


This repository is an alternative implementationof in `Rust` of the [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) spec. Not like `rust-libp2p`, `libp2p-rs` is written with async/await syntax, and driven by async-std. Even though, many codes are borrowed from `rust-libp2p` and some from `go-libp2p`. We are trying to keep compatible with the two implementations, but it is unfortunately not guaranteed.
